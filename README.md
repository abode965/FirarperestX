# FirarperestX
Firarperest is a Cross Platform Mobile Application with Xamarin to showcase my Photo Portfolio. I love photography and I compile photos on my personal blog whenever I visit new places. All photos are hosted on [http://ikivanc.tumblr.com](http://ikivanc.tumblr.com) .Using Xamarin new capabilities I would like to add new features such as stylish User Interface, data visulisation on map, places visited by country, photo gallery and so on. 

This project converted from
[Firarperest - Native Universal Windows Platform Photo Portfolio Application](https://github.com/ikivanc/Firarperest)
